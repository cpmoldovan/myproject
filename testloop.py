list=[i for i in range(2, 17, 5)] # 2+5= 7 ; 7+5=12; 12+5= 17; => aici se termina loop.
print(list)

# it's a particular syntax to write a loop.
# the third number in the range in this case 5, indicated the "jumps" that you have make
# from the first number to the last, so from 2 you have to do (2+5)=7 then 7+5 which is 12
# it stops at 12 because 12+5=17 which is the "stop number"
